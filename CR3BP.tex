\section*{Kinematics}
The transport theorem states that the inertial derivative of a vector $u$ is
\[\dd{^f \vv{u}}{t}=\dd{^r\vv{u}}{t}+\vv{\omega}^{rf}\times\vv{u}\]
Where $\dd{^f}{t}$ denotes the derivative in the coordinates of the fixed frame $f$, and $\dd{^r}{t}$ denotes derivative in the coordinates of the rotating frame $r$, and $\vv{\omega}^{rf}$ denotes the angular velocity of $r$ in $f$.

For a position vector $\vv{r}$, we will find the velocity $\dot{\vv{r}}$ and acceleration $\ddot{\vv{r}}$. Note that dot notation implies inertial.

\section*{Diagrams}
The circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP) is a special case of the three body problem. In the CR3BP (much like in Keplerian 2-body dynamics), we neglect the mass of satellite $S$, while treating the larger celestial body $B_1$ and smaller celestial body $B_2$ as point masses. Crucially, these bodies must orbit one another in circular orbits. In other words, they both orbit about their inertially stationary barycenter $c$ \textit{at constant velocity and distance}.

\end{figure}

Because $\hat{x}$ points from $c$ to $B_2$, which is not inertially stationary, the $xyz$ frame is rotating. Specifically, it is rotating positively about $z$. Because the celestial bodies are in a circular orbit, their rates of rotation about $c$ are constant. This means that the $xyz$ frame rotates at a constant rate of $\vv{\omega}=\Omega\hat{z}$
